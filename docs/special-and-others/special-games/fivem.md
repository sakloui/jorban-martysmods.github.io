# FiveM

FiveM is a modification platform for Grand Theft Auto V, typically used for PVP and roleplay servers. 

Unfortunately, FiveM requires procedures from the end user in order to properlly allow ReShade to be installed to their client.

This design choice stems from the FiveM developers and there is nothing that the ReShade community can do to circumvent this. 

Please do not ask for additional help in relation to getting FiveM to work in accordance of the ReShade Discord, as all of the information you need to get ReShade running in FiveM is in this guide.
