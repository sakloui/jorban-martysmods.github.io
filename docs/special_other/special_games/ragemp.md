# Installing ReShade to RageMP
While FiveM is a multiplayer modification platform for Grand Theft Auto V, it requires the ReShade injection binary to be in RageMP's folder to run.

Unfortunately, this is the way that the developers of RageMP have set up their client, and there is nothing that we can realistically can do about it.

In order to install ReShade properly to RageMP, you can proceed with the following step based guide that is presented below:

{: .warning}
Please note that RageMP uses Easy Anti-Cheat, so any shaders which requires the depth buffer or addons <b>will not work</b>.

------

### Step 1.
Open up the install location of RageMP with File Explorer.
The default location of RageMP will be `C:\RAGEMP
<img src="./images/ragemp/ragemp_install_location.png"/>

* Once open, copy the location of the game from the address bar in File Explorer.
  <img src="./images/ragemp/ragemp_install_address.png"/>
