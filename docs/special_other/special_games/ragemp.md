# Installing ReShade to RageMP
While FiveM is a multiplayer modification platform for Grand Theft Auto V, it requires the ReShade injection binary to be in RageMP's folder to run.

Unfortunately, this is the way that the developers of RageMP have set up their client, and there is nothing that we can realistically can do about it.

In order to install ReShade properly to RageMP, you can proceed with the following step based guide that is presented below:

----------------

### Step 1.
Open up the install location of RageMP with File Explorer.
The default location of RageMP will be `C:\RAGEMP`
  <div>
  <img src="./images/ragemp/ragemp_install_location.png" />
  </div>
 
 * Once open, copy the location of the game from the address bar in File Explorer.
  <div>
  <img src="./images/ragemp/ragemp_install_address.png" />
  </div>
 * Download the latest copy of ReShade from the [ReShade Website](https://reshade.me).

----------------

### Step 2.
 * Open the ReShade Installer.
 * In the ReShade Installer, click the browse function in the bottom right hand corner.
 * File Explorer will open, now paste the location of the game into the address bar of the File Explorer Window that has oppened.
 * Click `ragemp_v.exe` and then click "Open" in the bottom right hand corner of the File Explorer Window.
 * Continue with the ReShade installation as normal.
